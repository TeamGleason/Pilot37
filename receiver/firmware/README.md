The following firmware is based on the nRF5 SDK from Nordic Semiconductor.

To build the firmware, you will need the following:
 
* [nRF5-SDK version 13.0 or greater](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF5-SDK)

* Tools to build the SDK - [GNU/ARM](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads), RealView, or other)

* [nRF5 Command line tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52832)

A script to pull down a combination of tools that works is provided as
'nrf_setup'
